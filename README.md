# Animonds
is a really silly name for a project..... It's supposed to be a name for the little creatures that inhabit the environment I've created here.

This project is a platform for playing with reinforcement learning algorithms. It can render an environment and put Animonds in it. The current setup also supports adding homes for the animonds and food sources, with the goal of having the animonds learn to collect food and bring it home for storage.

# How to use
- Install all of the python requirements in `requirements.txt`.
- Run `python env.py` from the root directory of the project

You can customize the environment, by editing the various parameters within env.py as well as the supporting view rendering files.
